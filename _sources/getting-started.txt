Data Stream
------------
Any **iterable** object with **hashable** elements can be considered as a data stream. Here are some examples.

* a list of integers: :code:`[1, 10, 20, 1, 5]`
* a generator that yields tuples, see the instance :code:`dataStream` as follows,

.. code-block:: python
   
   import random

   def demoGen(N = 1000):
       i = 0
       while i < N:
           yield random.randint(0, 10);
           i += 1

   dataStream = demoGen()

* a tuple of strings: :code:`('fix', 'the', 'bug', please', '...')`
* a string: :code:`'abcdefgdahfahdfajkhfkahfsahfjksfhjk'`
* many more


Summarize the data stream
-------------------------
Many algorithms that are popular to summarize data streams are included
in the module **streamlib**. We give some examples to show their basic usage.

Count-Min Sketch
#################
Count-Min sketch [cm05]_ is used to summarize the data stream and estimate the frequency of each element in the data stream. This sketch give high accurate estimation to heavy hitters (elements that have high frequencies) while relatively large error may induced for light elements. See following example for the basic usage.

.. code-block:: python

    from streamlib import CountMin
    cm = CountMin() # create a instance of CountMin, see document for more detail
    cm.processBatch([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4])
    for i in xrange(5):
	print 'Estimated frequency of', i, 'is', cm.estimate(i)

result of above code,::

	Estimated frequency of 0 is 4
	Estimated frequency of 1 is 6
	Estimated frequency of 2 is 1
	Estimated frequency of 3 is 2
	Estimated frequency of 4 is 1

One can also create multiple instances of CountMin, each handle a substream (thus can be run in multi-threads).
By merging those instances, we obtain a summary of the joint stream of all substreams. See the following example.

.. code-block:: python


    from streamlib import CountMin
    cm0 = CountMin() # create a instance of CountMin, see document for more detail
    cm1 = cm0.reproduce() # reproduce a compatible sketch of cm0 
    

    cm0.processBatch([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4])
    cm1.processBatch([1, 2, 3, 4])
    for i in xrange(5):
	print 'Estimated frequency of', i, 'is', cm.estimate(i)

which gives,::

    Estimated frequency of 0 is 4
    Estimated frequency of 1 is 6
    Estimated frequency of 2 is 4
    Estimated frequency of 3 is 1
    Estimated frequency of 4 is 1
